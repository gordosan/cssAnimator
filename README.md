# CSS Animator

CSS Animator is a set of pre-made animations, written in only CSS

##How to

1- Include stylesheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="cssAnimator.css"> 
```

2- Apply the CSS class "animate" followed by the name of the animation 

```html
<div id="object" class="animate fadeIn">
```

3- (Optional) If you would like the animation to play in a loop, or in reverse, you can add the class "infinite" and/or "reverse"
```html
<div id="object" class="animate fadeIn reverse infinite">
```
